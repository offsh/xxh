This is a Fork from https://github.com/xxh/xxh

Intended to be used by the [offshell project](https://github.com/offsh/offshell)

The unique difference between original xxh and this fork is that this one adds an option to run extra code on start or end of each connection (code that would be executed in the local host instead of the remote one as it happens with the current plugin interface).
